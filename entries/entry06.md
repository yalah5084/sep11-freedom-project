### Takeaways from Expo Elevator Pitch

After the expo and giving the [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1shpbxsAaWqFo6IPwKE7x8-eL-dwld0u93BSauyyvK1U/edit) with my group, I realized that it's important to present something that you enjoy and are proud of. During the expo, my group and I were excited to present our final product and I thought about how things would've been different if we had chosen and made something that didn't interest us. With the elevator pitch, I learned that it's crucial to practice, get comfortable, and have an idea of what youâ€™re going to say, this way, you can improvise to add a few things while also remembering to stick to the main point. It's also essential to invite people to try your product because it can attract more people to try it. When I invited my friends to try our web app, it was visible that they were enjoying it and having fun which then made more people want to try our web app.


### Takeaways from In-Class Presentation

After the in-class [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_8MxmJPayiErrXJfTolRqKTbgeRMfMC7WGCa0AnGYow/edit#slide=id.g24345b7fa2e_0_228), I realized that I forgot to practice transitioning to the next person with my group. Next time, I'll make sure to practice transitioning so that the presentation flows smoothly. And since we presented twice, the first time we presented was a little messy because we didn't communicate certain things, so communicating and going over a presentation together many times is highly recommended and important. In case there's a video/gif in a presentation, you should narrate it unless there's a voice-over. Our presentation had two gifs and my teammates narrated some parts of it, but it would've been better if all three of us narrated the entire thing because sometimes people don't know what they looking at.


### Engineering Design Process and Skills

We're finally in the last stage of the engineering design process which is communicating the results, but we might go back to improve as needed in the future in case we want to add more features to our web app. Three skills I developed were communication, collaboration, and organization. My group and I collaborated in making the web app and the slides for the presentation. We talked about how to organize the slides, what to include, what to say, and which slides each of us are in charge of.
