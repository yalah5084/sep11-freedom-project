I've decided on the tool [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) because since my idea is to make a game that involves a map, Leaflet is the perfect tool for it. My idea is to make a game with a map where the user has to find an animal based on the hints provided. It would be an interactive map so the user will be able to navigate through it. Other tools I've considered was [Melon](https://melonjs.org/) and [Babylon](https://www.babylonjs.com/) because they have great graphics.

I’m currently in the define the problem stage in the engineering design process. Next stage will be researching the problem.

The two skills that I’m developing are how to read and consideration because I had to read the tools' official documentation in order to learn what they're about. I also had to consider which tool would best fit my idea for my project.
