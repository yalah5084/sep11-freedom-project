# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Yala Huang

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about creating anything you want using Javascript and the tool of you choice. The purpose of this blog is to show the process of how I created a web app with my group by tinkering with my tool, reading documentations and watching Youtube tutorials.

## Content
For the project, my group and I made a pet finder web app to help people find their lost pet by connecting with other people. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Leaflet in order to make a map in which the users can add markers on it with the information they provide such as the pet's name, description and coordinates.

## Implications
The pet finder web app have positive and negative impacts. On the positive side, the web app can create communities when people come together to assist each other in finding their lost pets. Pet owners can rely on this web app to quickly spread awareness and locate their missing pets. Over time, the web app will be the first place people will go to when their pet goes missing. As people are able find their lost pets efficiently, this can decrease the overcrowding in animal shelters, which also reduces the need for resources and space in the shelters that can be limited. It can also create jobs such as helping people locate their lost pet and maintaining and updating the web app. Additionally, people have the option to invest and fund the web app, while other people can receive compensation for locating someone's lost pet. Furthermore, internet is necessary to use the web app.
