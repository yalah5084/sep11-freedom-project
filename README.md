# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Yala Huang

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about creating anything you want using Javascript and the tool of your choice. The purpose of this blog is to show the process of how I created a web app with my group by tinkering with my tool, reading the official documentation, and watching Youtube tutorials.

## Content
For the project, my group and I made a pet finder web app to help people find their lost pets by connecting with other people. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying my tool Leaflet in order to make a map in which the users can add markers on it with the information they provide such as the pet's name, description, and coordinates.

## Implications
The pet finder web app has both positive and negative impacts. On the positive side, the web app can create communities where people come together to assist each other in finding their lost pets. Pet owners can rely on this web app to quickly spread awareness and locate their missing pets, which over time would make the web app the first place people would go when their pet goes missing. As people can find their lost pets more efficiently, this can decrease the overcrowding in animal shelters, which also reduces the need for resources and space in the shelters that can be limited. Moreover, the web app can create jobs such as helping people locate their lost pets and maintaining and updating the web app. Additionally, people have the option to invest and fund the web app, while other people can receive compensation for locating someone's lost pet. It's important to keep in mind that the internet is necessary to use the web app. On the other hand, people can be dishonest about finding a missing pet and/or ask for compensation for finding the missing pet. Furthermore, staff in animal shelters and volunteer work will decrease and traditional search methods will also decline such as flyers, posters, signs, etc. Unfortunately, people who don't have access to the internet won't be able to use the web app.
